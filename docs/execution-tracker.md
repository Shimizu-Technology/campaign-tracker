# Campaign Tracker Execution Tracker

Last updated: 2026-02-13  
Purpose: single operational checklist for what is done, what is in progress, and what comes next.

---

## How to Use This

- Move items between sections as work progresses.
- Keep status labels current: `todo`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`.
- Only mark `done` when acceptance criteria are met.
- Keep detailed execution tasks in this file (avoid creating parallel task lists).

---

## Now (Current Priority)

### 1) Role-Gated Supporter Editing
- Status: `done` (2026-02-13)
- Goal: restrict who can edit supporter records while keeping read access for staff.
- Scope:
  - Backend authorization on supporter update endpoint.
  - Frontend edit controls hidden/disabled for unauthorized roles.
  - Clear UX message for read-only users.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Unauthorized roles receive `403` on update attempts.
  - Authorized roles can edit and save successfully.
  - Automated tests cover allowed and forbidden cases.

### 2) Audit Log Depth Improvement
- Status: `done` (2026-02-13)
- Goal: make audit history operationally useful.
- Scope:
  - Store field-level diffs (`from` -> `to`) for updates.
  - Include actor role + action label in response/UI.
  - Keep list ordered by newest first.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Every supporter edit produces a readable diff entry.
  - UI clearly shows who changed what and when.
  - Backend tests verify audit payload shape.

### 3) Core Flow Verification Pass
- Status: `in_progress`
- Goal: verify end-to-end real workflow on desktop + mobile.
- Scope:
  - Public signup -> supporter appears in admin.
  - Assignment/edit on supporter detail.
  - Audit entry appears immediately after save.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Full checklist passes with no blocking defects.
  - Note: automated API/unit checks are passing; manual desktop/mobile run-through pending.
- Verification log (2026-02-13):
  - Automated checks: `rails test` (supporters controller), `eslint`, and `vite build` all passed.
  - API/auth behavior seen in logs:
    - Supporter detail endpoint returns `200` when authenticated.
    - Endpoint returns `401` when token/session is missing/expired (expected).
  - Pending manual browser pass (desktop + mobile):
    1. Public signup creates supporter and appears in admin list.
    2. Supporter detail opens in read-only mode by default.
    3. Role-gated edit behavior:
       - admin/coordinator can edit + save
       - non-editor roles see read-only notice and cannot edit
    4. Save action creates audit entry with readable field-level `from` -> `to` diffs.
    5. Back/Home navigation and unsaved-change guard behave correctly.

### 8) List UX Standardization (Search, Filters, Sorting)
- Status: `done`
- Goal: ensure all list-heavy pages support fast lookup and operations at campaign scale.
- Scope:
  - Define a shared list pattern for search + filters + sorting behavior.
  - Add search bars to key list pages that do not yet have search.
  - Add filter controls relevant to each page's domain (role, status, village, date, source, etc.).
  - Add sortable columns for table/list views, including click-to-sort column headers.
  - Normalize default sort order and clearly indicate active sort direction.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Every major list page supports search and at least one filter.
  - Table columns that represent sortable values support click-to-sort.
  - Sort/filter/search state is reflected in URL params where practical.
  - UX remains mobile-friendly and accessible (touch targets + keyboard/focus support).
- Completed implementation coverage:
  - `Supporters`: URL-backed search/filter/sort + desktop column sort controls.
  - `Users`: URL-backed search/filter/sort + role filtering.
  - `Events`: URL-backed search/filter/sort + status/type filtering.
  - `Leaderboard`: URL-backed search/filter/sort by rank/signup/village/leader.
  - `Poll Watcher`: URL-backed precinct search/filter/sort (village/reporting/turnout).
  - `War Room`: URL-backed village search/filter/sort controls in turnout grid.

### 9) Reporting Foundation (Requirements + First Report Set)
- Status: `todo`
- Goal: define and implement high-value operational reports for leadership and field teams.
- Scope:
  - Identify first reporting set with stakeholders (campaign admin + coordinators).
  - Define report dimensions (date range, village, precinct, role, source, turnout status).
  - Define output modes (on-screen summary cards/tables + CSV export).
  - Implement at least one end-to-end report module with filters and export.
  - Add report access control and audit trail for report generation/export actions (if needed).
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Report requirements are documented and approved.
  - At least one production-ready report is shipped with filters + export.
  - Report outputs are validated against known sample data.
  - RBAC rules for report visibility/access are enforced.

### 10) UX Motion and Transition Polish
- Status: `todo`
- Goal: improve perceived quality by smoothing abrupt UI state changes (sorting, filtering, section expand/collapse, data refresh states).
- Scope:
  - Define a small motion standard (durations/easing/reduced-motion behavior).
  - Apply smooth transitions to list re-sorts/filter refreshes and key card/table state changes.
  - Improve loading/refresh micro-interactions to avoid "snap" behavior.
  - Ensure motion remains subtle, fast, and accessible.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - High-traffic pages (supporters, users, events, dashboard cards) no longer feel abrupt during sort/filter changes.
  - Motion follows one consistent timing standard.
  - Reduced-motion preference is respected.
  - QA sign-off confirms improved UX smoothness without usability regressions.

### 11) Scale Hardening for 30,000+ Supporters/Voters (Do It Right)
- Status: `in_progress`
- Goal: make core pages and APIs production-ready for high-volume campaign data (30k+ supporter records) without band-aid fixes.
- Scope:
  - Define explicit performance budgets (p95 API response, list render time, query count limits).
  - Standardize server-side pagination/filter/sort across all list endpoints (no large client-side list operations for high-volume data).
  - Add/verify DB indexes for dominant query paths (supporters list filters, search, sort, war-room and poll-watcher reads).
  - Introduce selective caching for high-read dashboards/aggregates with safe invalidation strategy.
  - Add frontend strategy for large lists (incremental fetch, stable URL state, and where needed windowing/virtualization).
  - Add repeatable load/performance tests and capture baseline metrics before/after each optimization batch.
  - Add observability for key endpoints (request time, query count, error rate) in non-prod and production.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Supporters list interactions (search/filter/sort/page) remain responsive at 30k+ records.
  - Target endpoints meet agreed p95 latency budgets under representative load.
  - No N+1 regressions on high-traffic endpoints (validated by tests/profiling).
  - Performance test suite and baseline report are checked in and runnable by the team.
  - Operational runbook exists for performance troubleshooting and scaling decisions.

  - Refactored `war_room` aggregation to remove per-village N+1 count/sum queries.
  - Added supporter indexes:
    - `supporters(status, village_id)`
    - `supporters(status, village_id, motorcade_available)`
  - Re-ran 30k benchmark:
    - Before: `docs/performance/baseline-20260213-165604.json`
    - After: `docs/performance/baseline-20260213-170308.json`
  - Measured improvement (`war_room_index_payload`):
    - SQL query avg: `42.0` -> `5.0`
    - p50 latency: `44.52ms` -> `7.88ms`
    - p95 latency: `54.03ms` -> `8.84ms`
- 11.3 second optimization pass (2026-02-13):
  - Refactored dashboard aggregation to reuse preloaded village totals and avoid extra aggregate count/sum queries.
  - Added supporter list indexes:
    - `supporters(created_at)`
    - `supporters(village_id, created_at)`
    - `supporters(precinct_id, created_at)`
  - Re-ran 30k benchmark:
    - Before: `docs/performance/baseline-20260213-170308.json`
    - After: `docs/performance/baseline-20260213-170506.json`
  - Measured improvement:
    - `supporters_index_default` p50: `10.69ms` -> `5.47ms`
    - `dashboard_show_payload` p50: `18.62ms` -> `12.59ms`
    - `war_room_index_payload` p50: `7.88ms` -> `4.05ms`
  - Follow-up note:
    - `supporters_index_filtered_search` p95 remains volatile and should be addressed in next 11.3 pass (search-specific index strategy).
- 11.3 third optimization pass (2026-02-13):
  - Added search-specific trigram indexes:
    - `GIN (LOWER(supporters.print_name) gin_trgm_ops)`
    - `GIN (supporters.contact_number gin_trgm_ops)`
  - Updated supporter search logic to include digit-normalized phone matching.
  - Re-ran 30k benchmark:
    - Before: `docs/performance/baseline-20260213-170506.json`
    - After: `docs/performance/baseline-20260213-170652.json`
  - Measured search-path improvement:
    - `supporters_index_filtered_search` p50: `11.34ms` -> `9.28ms`
    - `supporters_index_filtered_search` p95: `42.44ms` -> `14.84ms`
  - Note:
    - non-search scenarios show expected run-to-run variance in development; primary validated gain is supporter search path.
- 11.3 election-day load validation pass (2026-02-13):
  - Added synthetic poll report generator task:
    - `rails "data:seed_synthetic_poll_reports[8]"` (with `RESET_TODAY=true` support)
  - Added index:
    - `poll_reports(reported_at)`
  - Seeded load:
    - `59 precincts * 8 reports = 472` poll reports for today
  - Post-load benchmark (first capture):
    - `docs/performance/baseline-20260213-170925.json`
    - `war_room_index_payload`: p50 `12.31ms`, p95 `25.26ms`, avg SQL `7.0`
    - `poll_watcher_index_payload`: p50 `6.32ms`, p95 `9.32ms`, avg SQL `3.0`
  - Repeat-run note:
    - subsequent dev captures showed significant wall-clock variance with stable SQL counts; final threshold sign-off should be done in isolated/staging environment.
- 11.3 staging sign-off package (2026-02-13):
  - Added one-command staging benchmark script:
    - `api/bin/performance_staging_run`
  - Added operator checklist:
    - `docs/performance/staging-benchmark-checklist.md`
  - Closure rule:
    - mark `11.3` as `done` after one clean staging run meets query-shape and latency consistency checks.
- 11.4 first frontend performance pass (2026-02-13):
  - Applied high-volume-focused improvements to `Supporters` list page:
    - debounced server-backed search input (`250ms`) to reduce query thrash on fast typing
    - preserved previous list data during refetch to avoid UI snap/flicker
    - adaptive row animation behavior: disables expensive row layout transitions for large datasets (`>= 5000`)
  - Files:
    - `web/src/hooks/useDebouncedValue.ts`
    - `web/src/pages/admin/SupportersPage.tsx`
  - Result:
    - smoother search/filter/sort interactions under high data volume with less render churn.
- 11.4 second frontend performance pass (2026-02-13):
  - Added server-backed page-size control on `Supporters` (`25/50/100/200` rows per page).
  - Added adjacent-page query prefetch for smoother next-page navigation under heavy datasets.
  - Persisted `per_page` in URL state for stable refresh/share behavior.
  - Result:
    - improved perceived responsiveness for high-volume browsing and pagination.
- 11.4 third frontend performance pass (2026-02-13):
  - Added progressive chunked row rendering for high-volume `Supporters` views (`>=5000` total rows + `per_page >= 100`).
  - Initial paint now renders a capped row subset, then incrementally hydrates remaining rows in short batches to reduce long main-thread paint spikes.
  - Added inline render-progress feedback (`Rendering X / Y rows...`) during chunk hydration for operator clarity on dense pages.
  - File:
    - `web/src/pages/admin/SupportersPage.tsx`
  - Verification:
    - `npm run lint` (web) -> pass
    - `npm run build` (web) -> pass
  - Result:
    - smoother first-paint and scroll responsiveness on 100-200 row pages under synthetic 30k supporter volume.
- 11.4 manual QA run (delegated to engineer):
  1. Prepare high-volume dataset:
     - Run `RESET=true bundle exec rails "data:seed_synthetic_supporters[30000]"` from `api/`.
     - Confirm app boots with seeded data and admin login works.
  2. Verify baseline browsing on `Supporters`:
     - Open `/admin/supporters`.
     - Set rows-per-page to `200/page`.
     - Confirm first render is responsive and page does not appear frozen during initial table paint.
  3. Verify progressive rendering behavior:
     - With `200/page` active, confirm temporary helper text appears (`Rendering X / Y rows...`) and disappears once row hydration completes.
     - Confirm no duplicate or missing rows after hydration settles.
  4. Verify high-volume interaction responsiveness:
     - Scroll through the table immediately after page load.
     - Apply `Village`, `Precinct`, and `Source` filters in sequence.
     - Change sort field/direction twice.
     - Expected: no major UI lockups; interactions remain usable while data refreshes.
  5. Verify search debounce and refetch stability:
     - Type a 10+ character search string quickly in the search input.
     - Expected: requests are not fired on every keystroke and list does not hard-flicker to empty between refreshes.
  6. Verify pagination smoothness:
     - Navigate page `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2`.
     - Expected: next-page transitions feel smoother (prefetch benefit), with no broken loading state.
  7. Verify URL/state persistence:
     - Keep non-default filters/sort/page size, refresh browser.
     - Expected: `per_page` and other URL-backed controls restore correctly.
  8. Capture QA evidence:
     - Record browser, machine profile, dataset size, and any visible lag points.
     - Append findings to this section with `pass/fail` per step and short notes.
- 11.4 closure criteria:
  - Mark `11.4` as `done` once delegated QA confirms steps 2-7 pass on 30k dataset with no blocking UX regressions.
- 11.5 implementation notes (2026-02-13):
  - Added request-level API performance instrumentation:
    - `api/app/services/request_performance_observer.rb`
    - `api/app/controllers/application_controller.rb` (`around_action :track_request_performance`)
  - Added per-request structured performance logging payload:
    - event: `api_request_performance`
    - fields: `method`, `path`, `status`, `duration_ms`, `sql_query_count`, `request_id`
  - Added response headers for quick endpoint inspection:
    - `X-Request-Duration-Ms`
    - `X-SQL-Query-Count`
  - Behavior:
    - enabled by default in non-test, non-production environments
    - production-gated by `REQUEST_PERF_OBSERVABILITY=true`
    - slow-request warning threshold configurable via `REQUEST_SLOW_THRESHOLD_MS` (default `500`)
  - Added periodic regression guardrail task:
    - `api/lib/tasks/performance_regression.rake`
    - `rails "performance:regression_check"` validates p95 + avg SQL guardrails against `docs/performance/baseline-latest.json`
  - Added convenience runner:

  - Env template updates:
    - `api/.env.example` now includes `REQUEST_PERF_OBSERVABILITY` and `REQUEST_SLOW_THRESHOLD_MS`
- 11.5 verification log (automated):
  - `bundle exec rails test test/controllers/api/v1/supporters_controller_test.rb` -> pass
  - `bundle exec rails "performance:regression_check"` -> pass
- 11.5 manual QA run (delegated to engineer):
  1. Local visibility check:
     - Ensure API is running in development.
     - Call `GET /api/v1/supporters` as an authorized user.
     - Confirm response contains `X-Request-Duration-Ms` and `X-SQL-Query-Count`.
  2. Log verification:
     - Inspect API logs for `event:"api_request_performance"` entries.
     - Confirm fields include path, status, request_id, duration, and query count.
  3. Slow-path threshold verification:
     - Temporarily set `REQUEST_SLOW_THRESHOLD_MS=1` in local env and restart API.
     - Trigger one endpoint request and confirm warning-level log behavior.
  4. Regression guardrail verification:
     - Run `api/bin/performance_regression_check` (or run `performance:capture_baseline` + `performance:regression_check` manually).
     - Confirm the command exits cleanly on pass and produces actionable output on failure.
  5. Staging production-gate verification:
     - With `REQUEST_PERF_OBSERVABILITY=false`, confirm no perf headers/log entries are emitted.
     - With `REQUEST_PERF_OBSERVABILITY=true`, confirm headers/log entries appear for API requests.
- 11.5 closure criteria:
  - Mark `11.5` as `done` after delegated QA confirms instrumentation visibility + guardrail task behavior in local/staging and logs results in this tracker.

### 12) Operations Configurability (Quotas + Precinct Metadata)
- Status: `in_progress`
- Goal: allow campaign head admins to safely adjust operational numbers/metadata that may change mid-campaign without engineering intervention.
- Scope:
  - Add admin-only quota management (per village target updates) in app.
  - Add guarded precinct metadata management (number/alpha range/polling site, activate/deactivate; avoid destructive deletes).
  - Keep village structural changes tightly restricted (minimal metadata edits only, if enabled).
  - Add audit history for all config changes with actor + field-level `from` -> `to` diffs.
  - Add validation and safe-guards to prevent breaking existing supporter mappings.
- Acceptance criteria:
  - Head admins can update quota targets from the UI and changes are reflected immediately in dashboard/village views.
  - Precinct metadata updates are possible without orphaning supporter records.
  - Sensitive operations are role-gated and fully audited.
  - Manual QA confirms change flow is understandable for non-technical campaign operators.
- Implementation task breakdown:
  - **12.1 Quota admin UI + API**

  - **12.2 Precinct metadata management**
    - Status: `done` (2026-02-13)
    - Add endpoints/UI for updating precinct number/alpha range/polling site and active state.
    - Block destructive operations that would break linked supporters.
    - Acceptance: admin can safely maintain precinct metadata in production.
  - **12.3 Audit + guardrails**
    - Status: `done` (2026-02-13)
    - Ensure all config edits emit auditable records.
    - Add confirmation prompts and input validation for high-impact changes.
    - Acceptance: every config change is traceable and reversible through controlled edits.
  - **12.4 Registered voter reference-data updates (village + precinct)**
    - Status: `done` (2026-02-13)

    - Keep strict guardrails: positive integer validation, role-gated access, and explicit save confirmation.
    - Record full audit trail (`from` -> `to`, actor, timestamp, metadata source note when provided).
    - Surface "last updated" context in admin UI so operators know data freshness.
    - Acceptance: authorized users can update voter counts safely, changes reflect in dashboard/ops views, and every change is fully auditable.
