# Campaign Tracker — Build Plan (POC for Feb 15 Meeting)

**Goal:** Walk into Saturday's meeting with a working demo that digitizes the blue form, shows a live dashboard, and tracks event/motorcade attendance.

---

## Decisions Made (Feb 12)

### Scope
- **POC focuses on:** Digital blue form + public QR signup + live dashboard + event attendance tracking
- **Referrals + performance hardening:** Phase 2 (after core functionality works)
- **Districts:** Configurable — admin can create/edit districts and assign villages. Not hardcoded.
- **Election Day War Room:** Phase 4 (future — after primary infrastructure is proven)

### Auth Flow
- **Admin (Leon/Auntie Rose):** Creates accounts for higher-ups
- **Higher-ups:** Can invite lower admins/chiefs/leaders via Clerk invitations
- **No self-registration** for staff — accounts are created by someone above you in the hierarchy
- **Public signup form:** No account needed (QR code / direct link)

### Design Direction
- **Tone:** Professional but accessible — campaign branding (Josh & Tina colors)
- **Mobile-first:** Block leaders and chiefs are in the field on phones
- **PWA installable:** "Add to Home Screen" for native app feel
- **No emojis in UI** — SVG icons only (lucide-react)
- Follow `FRONTEND_DESIGN_GUIDE.md` + `FRONTEND_DESIGN_SKILL.md`

## Data Model

### Campaigns
- name, election_year, election_type (primary/general), status (active/archived)
- candidate_names, party, branding (colors, logo)
- All data below is scoped to a campaign

### Districts (configurable by admin)
- name, number, campaign_id
- coordinator (user reference)

### Villages (reference data, pre-loaded with real GEC data)
- name, district_id, registered_voters, precinct_count
- chief (user reference), co_chief (user reference)
- All 19 Guam villages pre-seeded

### Precincts (reference data, pre-loaded with real GEC data)
- number, alpha_range, village_id, registered_voters, polling_site
- All 72 precincts pre-seeded from Jan 2026 GEC data

### Blocks/Sections
- name, village_id, leader (user reference)

### Users (Clerk-managed auth, app-managed roles)
- clerk_id, name, email, phone, role
- **Roles:** campaign_admin, district_coordinator, village_chief, block_leader, poll_watcher
- assigned_district_id, assigned_village_id, assigned_block_id
- Invitation flow: admin creates → Clerk sends invite email → user activates

### Supporters (the blue form data)
- print_name, contact_number, dob, email, street_address
- village_id, precinct_id, block_id
- registered_voter (boolean)
- yard_sign (boolean), motorcade_available (boolean)
- source: "staff_entry" / "qr_signup" / "referral"
- entered_by_user_id, referred_from_village_id (nullable)
- status: active / inactive / duplicate / unverified
- created_at (auto-timestamp)

### Quotas
- village_id (or district_id), target_count, target_date, period (weekly/monthly/quarterly)

### Events
- name, event_type: "motorcade" / "rally" / "fundraiser" / "meeting" / "other"
- date, time, location, description
- campaign_id, village_id (nullable — some events are island-wide)
- quota (minimum attendees needed)
- status: upcoming / active / completed / cancelled

### Event RSVPs
- event_id, supporter_id
- rsvp_status: "invited" / "confirmed" / "declined" / "no_response"
- attended (boolean — marked day-of via check-in)
- checked_in_at (timestamp, nullable)
- checked_in_by (user reference — who marked them present)

### Supporter Engagement (computed/cached)
Each supporter builds a track record over time:
- events_invited_count
- events_attended_count
- events_no_show_count
- **reliability_score:** (attended / invited) × 100
- last_event_date
- This data helps prioritize who to call on election day:
  - High reliability + hasn't voted = **urgent call**
  - Low reliability + hasn't voted = lower priority
  - Signed up but never attended anything = "paper supporter"

---

## Why Event Tracking Matters

The campaign team needs more than just names — they need to know who **actually shows up**.

**The problem:**
- They set a motorcade quota: "We need 200 cars in Dededo on Saturday"
- 300 people RSVP yes
- Only 150 show up
- Next time, they don't know if they should invite 400 or 500 to hit 200

**What the system solves:**
1. **Quota planning:** "Dededo supporters have a 62% show-up rate, so invite 325 to get 200"
2. **Accountability:** Village chiefs can see which block leaders' supporters are showing up vs. not
3. **Reliability scoring:** Over time, each supporter has a track record (attended 3/5 events = 60% reliable)
4. **Election day prioritization:** When calling supporters who haven't voted, prioritize those who've been showing up to events (they're more likely to follow through)
5. **Leaderboard/gamification:** Which village has the best turnout rate? Which block leader's supporters are most reliable?

**Day-of workflow:**
```
Event created (motorcade) → System pulls RSVPs from supporters
→ Day-of: Staff at check-in searches by name → Taps "Checked In"
→ Dashboard shows: 145/200 arrived (72.5%) — quota not met!
→ Post-event: Report shows who RSVPed yes but didn't show
```

## POC Scope (Build for Saturday)

### Must Have
1. **Public signup form** — Mobile-first, campaign-branded, QR code
   - Fields: Name, Phone, Village (dropdown), Street Address, Registered Y/N
   - Optional: Email, Yard Sign, Motorcade
   - "Thank you for supporting Josh & Tina!" confirmation
   - Generates unique QR per block leader (attributed signups)

2. **Staff entry form** — Authenticated, matches blue form layout
   - Auto-fills district/village/block based on logged-in user
   - Bulk mode: submit and immediately start next entry (tab-through)
   - Duplicate detection (same name + village = flag for review)

3. **Live dashboard** — Real-time supporter counts
   - Island-wide view: 19 villages with progress bars toward quota
   - Click village → see precinct-level breakdown + block leaders
   - Supporter count vs quota (thermometer style)
   - New signups today/this week
   - Color coding: Green (on track) / Yellow (behind) / Red (critical)
   - "Names needed per day to hit target" calculation

4. **Event attendance tracking**
   - Create events (motorcade, rally, etc.) with date, location, quota
   - Auto-populate RSVP list from supporters with motorcade_available = true
   - Day-of check-in: search by name → tap "Checked In" → timestamp
   - Post-event dashboard: invited vs attended, percentage, no-shows
   - Supporter reliability score (builds over time)

5. **Seed data** — All 19 villages, 72 precincts, real voter counts from Jan 2026 GEC data

### Nice to Have (if time)
6. Block leader leaderboard (who's collecting the most supporters)
7. CSV export of supporters
8. Basic role-based views (chief sees only their village)
9. Village-level event attendance breakdown
10. PWA manifest (installable on phone)

### Explicitly NOT in POC
- Election day war room (Phase 4)
- Referral system (Phase 2)
- SMS/text capabilities
- Offline mode / service worker
- Campaign finance tracking
- Social media integration

### Phase 2 Additions (Post-POC Hardening)
- **Dashboard performance hardening**
  - Keep query-count optimized dashboard aggregation (bulk grouped counts, no per-village count loops)
  - Add short-lived cache window for `/api/v1/dashboard` (target: 15-30s, with safe busting on supporter/event mutations)
- **War room performance pass**
  - Profile `war_room` endpoint query count and remove N+1 patterns
  - Add focused endpoint performance tests for election-day volume scenarios
- **Database/index tuning**
  - Review and add indexes for frequent filters/sorts (`supporters`, `poll_reports`, `event_rsvps`)
  - Validate with `EXPLAIN` for top read paths used in dashboard/war-room views
- **Observability**
  - Add lightweight request timing + query-count visibility for key admin endpoints in non-production environments
- **Signup/data model enhancements (optional based on operations feedback)**
  - Add supporter confirmation email option (in addition to existing SMS flow)
  - Split `street_address` into structured fields (e.g., street, village, zip/postal code)
  - Make precinct management configurable by admins if districting/commission mappings change
- **Supporter operations and accountability**
  - Add supporter profile page (`/admin/supporters/:id`) with richer details and edit actions
  - Add role-gated supporter edit capabilities (admin/coordinator first)
  - Add audit/history log for supporter changes (who changed what, when)
- **Mobile UX hardening sweep**
  - Complete responsive QA for all admin pages (filters, tables, headers, action bars)
  - Prioritize field-worker screens and supporter management flows for touch-first ergonomics
