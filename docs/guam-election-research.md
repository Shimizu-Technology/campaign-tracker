## 4. 2024 Election Results (Context)

### Key Turnout Data
- **Registered voters (2024):** 62,098
- **Votes cast (2024 General):** 30,283
- **Turnout: 48.77%** — less than half of registered voters actually voted
- **This means ~32,000 registered voters stayed home**

### 2024 Legislature Results (Relevant Candidates)
- **Tina Muña Barnes:** 14,662 votes (4.81%) — 5th among Democrats
- **Joe San Agustin:** 15,501 votes (5.09%) — 4th among Democrats (he's the primary opponent)
- **Republicans won 9-6 majority** — first time since 2006

### 2022 Governor Race
- **Lou Leon Guerrero (D):** 18,623 (55.5%) — won general
- **Felix Camacho (R):** 14,786 (44.1%)
- **Total votes cast:** 33,561
- **Dem primary:** Leon Guerrero 12,224 (62.5%) vs. San Nicolas 7,309 (37.4%)
- **Key insight:** You only need ~12-15K votes to win a Democratic primary

### Implication for Josh & Tina
The 2024 red wave means Democrats need a strong ground game. With ~53K registered voters and only ~30K voting, **mobilizing even 2-3K extra supporters to actually show up could swing the primary.** This is exactly what the campaign tracker is designed to do.

## 5. The 2026 Race

### Democratic Primary (Aug 1)
- **Josh Tenorio + Tina Muña Barnes** — Lt. Gov + Senator
- **Joe San Agustin** — Senator (confirmed opponent)
- Potentially others

### Republican Primary (Aug 1)
- **Vicente Ada**
- **Frank Blas Jr.** — Current Speaker of the Legislature
- **Marcel Camacho**

### Notes
- Josh Tenorio is the current Lt. Governor under Lou Leon Guerrero (who is term-limited)
- Campaign launched officially December 2025
- Campaigning already active — they were in Inalåhan on Jan 25, 2026
- PUA fraud scandal is a headwind for Tenorio — may be an attack angle from opponents

## 6. How Campaigns Get Voter Data

### From Guam Election Commission (GEC)
1. **Precinct-by-precinct breakdown** — Monthly PDF with registered voter counts by precinct (publicly available on gec.guam.gov). We already extracted Jan 2026 data above.

2. **Public Notice of All New Voters** — GEC publishes new voter registrations regularly. This is public data.

3. **Registered Voter Lists** — Under Guam law (3 GCA Chapter 3 — Voter Registration), the GEC maintains voter registration records. Political parties and campaigns can request voter rolls from the GEC.

4. **Election Day Results** — Available per-precinct from GEC (CSV files available for 2024).

### How to Request Voter Rolls
- Contact GEC directly: vote@gec.guam.gov or 671-477-9791
- Office: 241 Farenholt Avenue, Oka Bldg., 2nd Floor, Suite 202, Tamuning, GU 96913
- **Ask Auntie Rose:** Campaign teams typically have established channels to get voter data from GEC. She's done this across multiple campaigns since ~2009.

### What Voter Rolls Typically Include
- Name, address, village/precinct, registration date
- **Do NOT include:** phone, email, DOB (these are collected separately by the campaign via blue forms)
- This is why the blue form process exists — voter rolls tell you WHO is registered, but the campaign needs to know who SUPPORTS their candidate

## 7. Quota Estimation Framework

The PRD mentions "493 supporters by Feb 23" as an example for Tamuning. Here's how to think about quotas:

### Math Behind Quotas
- **53,628 total registered voters**
- **~48.8% turnout** historically → ~26,170 actual voters expected
- **Democratic primary** gets roughly 60-65% of voters (based on 2022: 19,560 Dem vs 3,026 Rep primary)
- **So ~15,000-17,000 voters** will vote in the Dem primary
- **To win primary**, Josh & Tina need ~8,000-10,000 votes (assuming 2-way race)

### Suggested Per-Village Targets (Proportional to Registered Voters)
| Village | Voters | % of Total | Target (if 10K goal) |
|---------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Dededo | 13,099 | 24.4% | ~2,440 |
| Yigo | 6,405 | 11.9% | ~1,190 |
| Tamuning | 4,935 | 9.2% | ~920 |
| Mangilao | 4,762 | 8.9% | ~890 |
| Barrigada | 3,694 | 6.9% | ~690 |
| Yona | 2,819 | 5.3% | ~530 |
| Chalan Pago/Ordot | 2,695 | 5.0% | ~500 |
| Mongmong/Toto/Maite | 2,091 | 3.9% | ~390 |
| Hågat | 1,945 | 3.6% | ~360 |
| Sånta Rita-Sumai | 1,812 | 3.4% | ~340 |
| Talo'fo'fo' | 1,636 | 3.1% | ~310 |
| Sinajana | 1,545 | 2.9% | ~290 |
| Agana Heights | 1,482 | 2.8% | ~280 |
| Inalåhan | 1,389 | 2.6% | ~260 |
| Malesso' | 902 | 1.7% | ~170 |
| Asan-Ma'ina | 859 | 1.6% | ~160 |
| Piti | 786 | 1.5% | ~150 |
| Humåtak | 428 | 0.8% | ~80 |
| Hagåtña | 344 | 0.6% | ~60 |

**Note:** These are ROUGH proportional targets. Real quotas should factor in:
- Historical Democratic support by village
- Village chief capability/network size
- Turnout patterns (southern villages tend to have lower turnout)
- Whether the village is a stronghold or swing area

**The campaign team will have better instincts on these numbers.** Present this as a starting framework they can adjust.

## 8. Competitive Analysis — Existing Campaign Tools

### What Mainland Campaigns Use
| Tool | What It Does | Pricing | Guam Fit? |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| **NGP VAN** | Voter file, canvassing, phone bank, fundraising | $$$, Dem party only | ❌ Designed for mainland, overkill |
| **NationBuilder** | CRM + website + outreach | $29-99/mo | ❌ Generic, doesn't fit Guam structure |
| **Ecanvasser** | Door-to-door canvassing with maps | $$$ | ❌ GPS/map focused |
| **Trail Blazer** | Campaign management | $$ | ❌ Generic |

### Why Custom Is Better
1. **Guam's unique hierarchy** (Campaign HQ → District → Village Chief → Block Leader) doesn't fit any mainland tool
2. **72 precincts across 19 villages** — small enough to be highly personal
3. **The "blue form" workflow** is specific to this campaign style
4. **War room relay system** (poll watcher → nearby house → HQ) is unique
5. **No subscription fees** — they own it forever, reuse across campaigns
6. **Bilingual** potential (English + Chamorro)
7. **Mobile-first** — block leaders are in the field on their phones

### What Calvo's Campaign Did
- QR code signup form (mentioned in meeting notes)
- Unknown if they had a backend dashboard
- This is the direct competitor reference — we should match and exceed it

## 9. Legal / Privacy Notes

### Guam Election Law (3 GCA)
- 16-year-olds can pre-register (active at 18)
- 17-year-olds can vote in primaries if they'll be 18 by the general election
- Voter registration transfers between precincts are NOT permitted between primary and general elections
- Campaign finance reporting is required (forms available on GEC site)

### Data Privacy
- Supporter data (blue form) is campaign-collected, NOT government data — the campaign owns it
- Voter rolls are public records available to campaigns
- **Recommendation:** Keep supporter data (phone, email, preferences) separate and secure. Only authorized campaign staff should access personal contact info.
- The system should have role-based access (addressed in PRD §3)

## 10. Questions to Confirm at Saturday Meeting

### Must-Answer (Blocks Development)
1. ✅ Precinct-to-village mapping — **ANSWERED** (72 precincts, see §3 above)
2. What are the **campaign districts**? Which villages are grouped together? How many district coordinators?
3. What are the **real quota targets** per village? (We have a proportional framework — do they have specific numbers?)
4. Does the campaign have access to the **voter roll** from GEC? In what format (PDF, spreadsheet, database)?

### Important (Shapes Features)
5. How many **admins** total? Who sees everything vs. limited access?
6. Is there a **budget** for this? Or is it a family/volunteer effort?
7. **Domain** preference? (e.g., joshandtina2026.com/tracker or separate)
8. Do they want **SMS/text** capabilities? (Twilio costs money)
9. Should we match/exceed the **Calvo QR code** signup?

### Good to Know (Future Phases)
10. Internet reliability at **polling locations** (for election day war room)
11. How many **poll watchers** per precinct?
12. **War room** size — how many call bank operators?
13. Previous election **support lists** — any existing data to import?
