Last updated: 2026-02-13

Use this as a fast operator guide for poll watchers in the field.

---

## What You Are Responsible For

- Report precinct turnout updates throughout the day.
- Keep supporter strike list current (`Voted` vs `Not Yet Voted`).
- Log contact outcomes (`Call Attempted`, `Reached`) for outreach tracking.
- Escalate issues quickly when polling-site problems occur.

Important: This app tracks campaign operations, not official election records.

## Before Polls Open

1. Sign in and open `/admin/poll-watcher`.
2. Confirm your assigned precincts are visible.
3. Open one precinct and confirm supporter strike list loads.
4. Confirm you can see your polling-site metadata.
5. Keep war-room escalation contact handy.

---

## During the Day (Repeat)

1. Select your precinct.
2. Submit current `voter_count` report.
3. In strike list:
   - mark supporters `Voted` when confirmed
   - leave/mark supporters `Not Yet Voted` when pending
4. Log outreach result:
   - `Call Attempted` when tried but no confirmed reach
   - `Reached` when supporter confirmed reached
5. Add notes when useful (line issues, special context, blockers).

---

## If You See Issues

- Use report type `Report Issue` in precinct reporting.
- Include clear note (what happened, where, when).
- Escalate immediately to war room lead/coordinator.

---

## End-of-Day Closeout

1. Submit final precinct turnout report.
2. Ensure key supporter statuses are updated.
3. Confirm unresolved high-priority items were handed off.
4. Sign out and report any unresolved blockers.

## Common Mistakes To Avoid

- Reporting on a precinct outside your assignment.
- Forgetting to update strike-list statuses after confirmed outreach.
- Logging outcomes without useful notes when context is needed.
- Waiting too long to escalate precinct issues.
