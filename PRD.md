# Campaign Tracker — Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0 (Draft)
**Date:** February 3, 2026
**Author:** Jerry (Shimizu Technology)
**Status:** DRAFT — Needs review & clarification before build

---

## 1. Overview

A web application to digitize and automate the campaign supporter tracking process for the Guam gubernatorial election. Replaces paper-based "Block List" forms with a digital system that handles supporter sign-up, quota tracking, organizational hierarchy management, event check-ins, and real-time election day voter turnout monitoring.

**Working Name:** Campaign Tracker (TBD — open to a better name)
**Initial Campaign:** Josh Tenorio & Tina Muña Barnes for Governor & Lt. Governor
**Architecture:** Multi-campaign platform — reusable across elections and candidates

---

## 2. Problem Statement

The current campaign process is entirely manual:
- **Paper forms** ("Block List" / blue form) are used to collect supporter info — 10 names per sheet
- Block leaders hand-deliver forms up the chain to village chiefs → district coordinators → campaign HQ
- **Data entry** is manual — someone has to type everything into a spreadsheet
- **Quota tracking** (how many supporters per village by what date) is done by hand
- **Election day** relies on poll watchers physically highlighting names on paper lists, relaying info through runners to a "war room" where people manually cross-reference who hasn't voted
- **No real-time visibility** — campaign leadership can't see progress until data is manually compiled

This creates delays, errors, lost data, and no ability to course-correct in real-time.

## 3. Target Users & Roles

| Role | Who | What They Do | Access Level |
|------|-----|-------------|--------------|
| **Campaign Admin** | Auntie Rose, campaign leadership | Full system access, set quotas, manage hierarchy, war room on election day | Everything |
| **District Coordinator** | Heads of campaign districts (e.g., Leon's mom = District 2) | Manage village chiefs, see district-wide progress, enter supporters | Their district + all villages under it |
| **Village Chief** | Village-level campaign leader (+ optional co-chief) | Manage block leaders, see village progress, enter supporters | Their village + all blocks under it |
| **Block/Section Leader** | Grassroots-level, assigned to a neighborhood | Collect supporter sign-ups (paper or digital), enter data | Their block's supporters only |
| **Poll Watcher** | At voting sites on election day | Mark off voters as they vote | Their precinct's voter list (election day only) |
| **War Room Operator** | Campaign HQ on election day | Monitor all precincts, manage call bank, identify non-voters | Read-only dashboards + call lists |
| **Supporter** | The public | Self-signup via QR code / shared link (no account required) | Public form only |

---

## 4. Organizational Hierarchy

```
Campaign HQ (Auntie Rose)
└── District (internal campaign designation)
    ├── District Coordinator (e.g., Mom = District 2)
    └── Village (official Guam village)
        ├── Village Chief + Co-Chief
        └── Block / Section (neighborhood subdivision)
            └── Block Leader
                └── Supporters (the actual people)
```

**Key distinction:**
- **Village** = official Guam municipality (e.g., Tamuning, Dededo, Yigo)
- **Precinct** = election commission voting division (a large village may have multiple precincts)
- **District** = internal campaign grouping of villages (NOT a government designation)
- **Block/Section** = subdivision of a village, defined by the village chief

---

## 5. Data Model (Conceptual)

### 5.1 Multi-Campaign Structure

**Campaigns** (top-level tenant — e.g., "Josh & Tina 2026", "Previous Campaign 2022")
- name, election_year, election_type (primary/general), status (active/archived)
- candidate_names, party, branding (colors, logo)
- All data below is scoped to a campaign

**Districts** (internal campaign grouping — changes per campaign)
- name, number, description, campaign_id
- coordinator (user reference)

**Villages** (Guam's 19 municipalities — shared reference data, not campaign-specific)
- name, district_id
- chief (user reference), co_chief (user reference)
- precinct_ids (a village may span multiple precincts)
- quota targets (by period)

**Precincts**
- number/name, village_id (or village_ids if a precinct spans villages?)
- polling_location (name, address)
- registered_voter_count (from election commission data)

**Blocks/Sections**
- name/number, village_id
- leader (user reference)

### 5.2 People

**Users** (campaign staff — anyone with a login)
- name, email, phone, role, password
- assigned_district_id, assigned_village_id, assigned_block_id (based on role)

**Supporters** (collected from blue forms / digital sign-up)

*Original blue form fields:*
- print_name, contact_number, dob, email, street_address
- registered_voter (Y/N)

*Added per mom's direction (not on paper form):*
- village (per supporter — paper form only has this in the header)
- precinct
- yard_sign (Y/N) — "will you put a sign on your yard?"
- motorcade_available (Y/N) — "will you join motorcades?"

*System fields:*
- block/section
- source: "block_leader_entry" | "self_signup" | "referral"
- entered_by (user reference, null if self-signup)
- referral_from (village/user, if referral)
- created_at (auto-timestamp)
- status: "active" | "inactive" | "duplicate" | "unverified"

**Registered Voters** (imported from election commission)
- name, precinct, village
- This is the master list used on election day to check off who voted

### 5.3 Election Day

**Vote Tracking**
- registered_voter_id
- precinct_id
- voted_at (timestamp)
- marked_by (poll watcher user)
- hour_block (for hourly reporting)

### 5.4 Events

**Motorcades / Events**
- name, date, location
- expected_attendees (from supporter motorcade_available)
- check_ins (supporter_id, checked_in_at)

### 5.5 Quotas

**Quota Targets**
- village_id (or district_id)
- period: "weekly" | "monthly" | "quarterly"
- target_date
- target_count
- actual_count (computed)

**6.2 Public Self-Signup (QR Code / Link)**
- No login required
- Simple mobile-friendly form: name, phone, email, DOB, address, village
- Auto-detects precinct from village (if mapping is known?)
- Generates unique QR codes per block leader / village chief
- QR code encodes a URL with the leader's ID so the supporter gets attributed correctly

## 7. Technical Architecture (Proposed)

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Backend | Rails 8 API | Fast to build, proven stack, same as other Shimizu projects |
| Frontend | React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind | Same stack, reusable components |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Relational data, good for reporting |
| Auth | Simple email/password (built-in) | Campaign staff only — no public accounts needed |
| Hosting | Render (API) + Netlify (frontend) | Same as other projects |
| Real-time | ActionCable (WebSockets) or polling | For election day live updates |
| Offline | Service Worker + IndexedDB | Poll watchers need offline capability |
| QR Codes | `rqrcode` gem (backend) or client-side JS | For self-signup links |

**Mobile-first design** — block leaders are in the field, poll watchers are on phones.

---

## 8. Branding & Design

- Campaign colors: Match Josh & Tina campaign (blue from the form — need exact hex codes)
- Logo: "Vote Josh & Tina" branding on public-facing pages
- Internal pages: Clean, professional, fast
- Follow Shimizu frontend design guide (SVG icons, no emojis, 44px touch targets, Framer Motion)

---

## 9. Timeline (Proposed)

| Phase | Target | What Ships |
|-------|--------|-----------|
| Phase 1 | Feb 10-14 | Digital form, QR signup, supporter database — **Tamuning only** |
| Phase 2 | Feb 21 | Quota dashboards, reporting (before Feb 23 deadline) |
| Phase 3 | March-April | Expand to all 19 villages, motorcade check-in, events |
| Phase 4 | July | Election day war room, poll watcher app, call bank |

**Scope:** Phase 1 starts with **Tamuning only** — one village, its precincts and blocks. Expand island-wide after proven.
**Critical date:** Feb 23 — first quota deadline
**Critical date:** Aug 1 — Primary Election Day

## 10. ❓ Questions & Clarifications Needed

### ✅ Answered (Feb 3, 2026)

1. ✅ **Villages:** 19 villages on Guam (see `docs/guam-villages.md` for full list with 2020 census populations). Largest: Dededo (44,908), Yigo (19,339), Tamuning (18,489). Total island population: 153,836. **Still need:** exact precinct count per village + district assignments from Auntie Rose.

2. ✅ **Quotas:** 493 was just an example, not the real Tamuning quota. Tamuning has 18,489 people — actual quotas will be much larger. **Still need:** real quota numbers from the campaign team.

3. ✅ **Ryan:** Works at Guam airport. Been Auntie Rose's tech person since ~2009 across multiple campaigns. May be too busy for this one. This system likely replaces what he used to do manually.

4. ✅ **Multi-campaign: YES.** Auntie Rose has run multiple campaigns over the years. Data must persist across elections. If candidates win and run again, same system. **Architecture: multi-campaign platform, not single-use.**

5. ⏳ **Registered voter list** — Need to ask campaign team how they get election commission data and in what format.

### Still Need Answers

6. **Precinct-to-village mapping** — How many precincts per village? Need from election commission or Auntie Rose.

7. **District assignments** — Which villages belong to which campaign districts? How many districts total?

8. **Who are the admins?** Just Auntie Rose? A team? How many people will have full access?

9. **Calvo's QR system** — Can Leon get a screenshot/link of the competing campaign's digital signup?

10. **Domain / hosting?** Campaign domain or Shimizu subdomain for now?

11. **Budget for SMS?** Twilio for text reminders / call bank — in scope or not?

### Should Clarify But Won't Block Phase 1

11. **Referral form approval flow** — When someone refers a supporter to a different village, does the village chief need to approve it? Or auto-add?

12. **Data privacy / legal** — Any Guam-specific laws about storing voter data or supporter information digitally? Campaign finance implications?

13. **Previous election data** — The notes mention "a support list from the previous election." Is there existing data to import? What format?

14. **Internet at polling sites** — Do all voting locations have reliable WiFi/cell signal? If not, offline mode becomes critical for Phase 4.

15. **Poll watcher logistics** — How many poll watchers per precinct? Do they rotate shifts? Multiple devices per precinct?

16. **War room size** — How many operators in the call bank? 5? 20? 50? (Affects concurrent user load)

17. **"Hour or period" highlighting** — The transcript mentions poll watchers use different colored markers for different time periods. Should the digital version track the hour/period when each vote is recorded? (I'd say yes — useful for turnout analysis)

18. **Block leader accountability** — Should block leaders be able to see each other's numbers? Or only their own? (Gamification vs privacy)

19. **Supporter verification** — Is there a step where someone verifies the supporter data is accurate before it counts toward quotas? Or does every entry count immediately?

20. **Duplicate handling** — Same person signed up by a block leader AND via QR code. How to handle? Auto-merge? Flag for review?

## 11. Out of Scope (for now)

- OCR/scanning of existing paper forms (mentioned in meeting — revisit later)
- Automated phone calls / robocalls
- Social media integration
- Campaign donation tracking
- Candidate scheduling / tour planning
- Media/press management

---

## 12. Success Metrics

- **Phase 1:** All block leaders entering data digitally instead of paper by Feb 23
- **Phase 2:** Campaign leadership can see live quota progress without asking anyone
- **Phase 4:** Election day voter tracking happens in real-time, not hours delayed
- **Overall:** More supporters contacted, higher turnout on election day
