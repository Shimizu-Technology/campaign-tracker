# Campaign Tracker — Phase 2 Feature Ideas

**Prepared for:** Ricky Demo (Feb 24, 2026)
**Purpose:** Ideas to make CT indispensable for the Josh & Tina campaign

---

## 1. Communication & Outreach

### WhatsApp Integration
Send campaign updates and reminders via WhatsApp — the dominant messaging platform in Guam. Two-way conversations with supporters, broadcast lists by village/district.
- **Why it matters:** Email open rates are ~20%. WhatsApp is 90%+. Meet supporters where they already are.
- **Complexity:** High | **Priority:** Must-have

### Automated Follow-Up Reminders
System automatically flags supporters who haven't been contacted in X days. Generates task lists for block leaders: "These 15 people in your block haven't heard from anyone in 2 weeks."
- **Why it matters:** No supporter falls through the cracks. Campaign stays top-of-mind.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

### SMS Conversation Threads
Two-way texting with supporters. See full conversation history. Auto-log interactions.
- **Why it matters:** Block leaders can have real conversations, not just blast messages.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Nice-to-have

### Message Template Library
Pre-written, approved templates for common scenarios: welcome, event invite, reminder to vote, thank you. Customizable with supporter name, village, event details.
- **Why it matters:** Consistent messaging across hundreds of volunteers. No off-brand texts.
- **Complexity:** Low | **Priority:** Must-have

## 2. Field Operations

### Door-to-Door Canvassing Mode
Map-based interface showing which houses to visit. Track: visited, not home, supportive, undecided, opposed. Optimized walk routes by neighborhood.
- **Why it matters:** The ground game wins elections. This turns random door-knocking into strategic operations.
- **Complexity:** High | **Priority:** Must-have (for general election)

### GPS-Tagged Supporter Sign-ups
When a block leader signs up a supporter in the field, automatically tag with GPS location. Visualize supporter density on a map.
- **Why it matters:** See exactly where your support is strong and where you need more outreach.
- **Complexity:** Low | **Priority:** Nice-to-have

### Offline Mode
Cache supporter lists and sign-up forms locally. Sync when back online. Essential for remote villages or areas with spotty cell service.
- **Why it matters:** Can't lose sign-ups because of bad signal. Field workers need reliability.
- **Complexity:** High | **Priority:** Nice-to-have

### Walk List Generation
Generate optimized walk lists for canvassers: sorted by geography, filtered by contact status, printable for workers without smartphones.
- **Why it matters:** Not everyone has a smartphone. Paper walk lists are still essential — but they can be smart.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

## 3. Analytics & Intelligence

### Geographic Heat Maps
Interactive map of Guam showing supporter density, quota progress, and outreach coverage by village and precinct. Color-coded by status.
- **Why it matters:** One glance tells you where you're strong and where you're losing. Campaign leadership makes better decisions.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

### Conversion Funnel
Track the journey: Signed up → Contacted → Committed → Event attended → Voted. See where people drop off.
- **Why it matters:** If 500 sign up but only 200 commit, you know where to focus energy.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

### TV Dashboard Mode
Full-screen, auto-refreshing dashboard designed for a big screen on the wall at campaign HQ. Real-time numbers, village progress bars, today's sign-ups ticker.
- **Why it matters:** Everyone who walks into HQ sees the numbers. Creates urgency and motivation.
- **Complexity:** Low | **Priority:** Must-have

### Predictive Turnout Modeling
Based on historical data + current supporter engagement, predict election day turnout by precinct. Identify which precincts need the most election-day effort.
- **Why it matters:** Allocate poll watchers and resources where they'll have the most impact.
- **Complexity:** High | **Priority:** Future

### Weekly Campaign Report (Auto-Generated)
Every Monday morning, auto-generate a PDF report: new supporters this week, quota progress, top-performing villages, areas of concern, upcoming events.
- **Why it matters:** Campaign leadership gets a professional briefing without anyone having to compile it manually.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

## 4. Volunteer Management

### Shift Scheduling
Create volunteer shifts for events, phone banks, canvassing. Volunteers sign up for open slots. Automatic reminders before shifts.
- **Why it matters:** Coordinating hundreds of volunteers by text/phone is chaos. Self-service scheduling saves everyone time.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

### Task Assignment & Tracking
Assign specific tasks to volunteers: "Call these 20 people," "Deliver yard signs to these addresses," "Set up for Saturday event." Track completion.
- **Why it matters:** Clear accountability. Nothing falls through the cracks.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

### Volunteer Hours & Recognition
Track hours contributed. Leaderboard of top volunteers. Certificates or badges for milestones (100 hours, 50 sign-ups, etc.).
- **Why it matters:** Recognition keeps volunteers motivated. Hours tracking is useful for community service credits.
- **Complexity:** Low | **Priority:** Nice-to-have

## 5. Election Day Enhancements

### Live Voter Turnout Map
Real-time map showing voter turnout percentage by precinct, updated as poll watchers check off voters. Color shifts from red (low turnout) to green (high turnout).
- **Why it matters:** War room sees EXACTLY where turnout is lagging and can deploy resources in real-time.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

### Automated "Go Vote" Reminders
At 12 PM and 3 PM, automatically send SMS/WhatsApp to supporters who haven't been marked as voted yet. "Polls close at 7 PM — have you voted yet?"
- **Why it matters:** Every vote counts. Automated reminders free up the call bank for personal outreach.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Must-have

### Ride-to-Polls Coordination
Supporters can request a ride. Volunteer drivers see a queue of ride requests with locations. Simple pickup/dropoff tracking.
- **Why it matters:** Transportation is a real barrier, especially for elderly voters. This removes it.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Nice-to-have

### Issue Reporting
Poll watchers can report issues: long lines, machine problems, accessibility concerns. War room sees all issues on a map with status (reported → acknowledged → resolved).
- **Why it matters:** Quick response to problems. Documentation for any post-election disputes.
- **Complexity:** Low | **Priority:** Must-have

---

## 6. Multi-Campaign & Post-Election

### Supporter Database Carry-Forward
After the election, keep the supporter database. For the next campaign cycle, start with a warm list instead of from zero.
- **Why it matters:** The database IS the asset. Every campaign builds on the last one.
- **Complexity:** Low | **Priority:** Future

### Results Tracking & Analysis
After election day, import official results by precinct. Compare predicted vs. actual turnout. Analyze what worked and what didn't.
- **Why it matters:** Data-driven improvement for the next election.
- **Complexity:** Medium | **Priority:** Future

### Multi-Race Support
Run multiple campaigns simultaneously (governor, senator, mayor) with shared supporter data but separate dashboards and quotas.
- **Why it matters:** Party-level tool, not just single-campaign. Multiplies the value.
- **Complexity:** High | **Priority:** Future

## The Vision

Campaign Tracker isn't just a sign-up tracker — it's the **operating system for running a modern campaign in Guam**. Every aspect of campaign operations flows through one platform: supporter outreach, volunteer coordination, field operations, election day execution, and post-election analysis.

No campaign in Guam has ever had this level of technology. This is the difference between running a campaign on paper and sticky notes vs. running it like a Silicon Valley operation.

**The database of 40,000+ registered voters, combined with real-time supporter tracking and election day monitoring, gives the Josh & Tina campaign an unprecedented advantage.**
